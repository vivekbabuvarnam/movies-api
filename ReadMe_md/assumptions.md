# Assumptions
************
* Endpoint to get Top 10 movie based on rating will be taken from our database and not from the OMDBAPI service
* Docker/K8S images not required to be in the docker registry
* Source code not to be kept in the gitHub
* I have used docker desktop to run the application in my laptop to run as docker container or in Kubernetes
